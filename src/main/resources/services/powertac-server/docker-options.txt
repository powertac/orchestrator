DOCKER_OPTIONS:
   these are options for the `docker run` command
   you can find a detailed description of all options in the docker documentation:
   https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/

   In the beginning you probably want to use the `-v` option which allows you to bind the /data/bootstrap/ directory
   of the container to a local directory.

   If you want to remove the docker container after it has completed its task, use the `--rm` option. It will remove
   the container and the volumes assigned to it when it's done.

VERSION:
    the version of the server you want to use; if you don't know which to use `latest` is a good start.
