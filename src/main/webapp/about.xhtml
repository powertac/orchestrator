      <p>This web application manages brokers, servers, games, and game
        visualizers for PowerTac Tournaments. It is deployed with a number of
        available server machines and corresponding visualizers. Tournaments can
        be composed for a set of brokers, having multiple games of different
        sizes (numbers of competing brokers), in such a way that every broker
        sees the same number of <i>n</i>-player games. Games are scheduled
        dynamically, since game length is indeterminate, and the schedule must
        respect constraints on the number of available servers and the number of
        available brokers from each team.
